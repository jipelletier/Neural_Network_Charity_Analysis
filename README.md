# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Project Overview & Purpose

Deep Neural networks are used for analyzing images and processing datasets. They are modeled after neurons in the brain to be effective with datasets that are complex.

This project used the features provided in the dataset to create binary classifier that predicts whether applicants will be succesful being funded by Alphabet Soup, a non profit organization.
